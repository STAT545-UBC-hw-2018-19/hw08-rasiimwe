### Assignment overview 
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) is an R package that makes it easy to build to build interactive web applications with R . Shiny is available on CRAN and can be installed using:

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```
With Shiny, we can:
* Host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards 
* embed CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions within Shiny apps for flexibility
* develop highly interactive apps and output changes as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser
* tap into Shiny's very attractive user interfaces (based on Twitter Bootstrap) and the customizable slider widgets with support animations
* enjoy the super fast data transfer between a browser and R
* tap into the reactive programming model that helps us focus on the key application code without worrying about backgorund subroutines.


The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).
