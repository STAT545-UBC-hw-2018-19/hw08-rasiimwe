This repo contains the BC Liquor app as a boilerplate for students to add to in Homework 08.

The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).

The homework is due Wednesday, November 21, 2018, at 23:59.

***Your task is to add three features to the app, and deploy it.***

**2: The deployed app runs. The README file describes either a new app or 3 additions to the BC Liquor Store app. Whatever is described in the README is actually implemented in the app. 90%**

**3: Amazing Shiny app. Not only did you implement 3 new features, but the features are very cool / allow for great insight; or, you made a new app with at least three features. App looks great visually.**

**Components of a Tidy Submission

Be sure your submission includes all of the following components:

Your app should be deployed online on shinyapps.io (or on other server if you’d like). Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier).

Describe your app in your homework repository’s README, and add a link to the URL where the app is hosted.

Include the code for your Shiny app in your homework repository, as the marker will need to review your code.

Whatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly and extensively. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.

**The Assignment

We’ll leave it up to you to choose what three features you’d like to add to the app, but they must satisfy the following guidelines:

There’s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output.
There’s at least one change the ui (aside from the addition of a widget).
